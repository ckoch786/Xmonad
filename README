     http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_XFCE
     
 and
     http://ivanmiljenovic.wordpress.com/2008/01/20/xmonad/

     got through the tutorial(s) to configure XFCE for xmonad.
     The first link should be enough but the second has some additional info.


HOWTO use:

Make a backup of your xmonad.hs and copy over the 

    xmonad.hs to .xmonad 


Add this line to your .xinitrc

    exec startxfce4


startx and you should be in a somewhat fully integrated XFCE Xmonad
environment!
